•	Use Matplotlib to create visualizations to compare findings and show COVID-19s impact to the Airline Industry
•	Summarize major findings including a heading for each question answered with a short description of findings.

Research questions to answer:
•	How is the COVID-19 virus affecting the Airline Industry?
•	How has the COVID-19 virus affected North Carolina?
